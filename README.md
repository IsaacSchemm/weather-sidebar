Weather Sidebar
===============

https://www.lakora.us/weather

This is a cross-browser weather forecast sidebar. It shows the current
temperature and weather, along with an hourly forecast for the next 12 hours,
using the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/).

Weather icons can use native emoji (the default on most systems) or
[Twitter emoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) (the default on
Windows 7 and prior.)

Weather Sidebar does not have any name / zipcode support for location lookup
at this time. Instead, either use the browser's geolocation support (default)
or enter your own latitude/longitude in the settings area.

Browser requirements:
* Firefox / Pale Moon
  * Add Weather Sidebar to your bookmarks, then edit the bookmark properties
    to open in the sidebar. For more details, see:
